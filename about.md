These are the words the CTO has exclaimed when I reduced the application load time of 80%. I am very committed to this kind of results, I always look forward to improve what we have and innovate, innovate and innovate. I am not a conservative guy, I don't like the rules, they are written to be re-written when they don't fit anymore. In this dynamic world they are old before you finish to write them.

I am an open-source passionate, love the Scala language, the functional programming and clean code. I love writing testable and self explaining code, my favorite quote is: “Code as if the next guy to maintain your code is a homicidal maniac who knows where you live.”

In my spare time I like to do DIY as well some sport, love the sea, snorkeling and sailing boats. I will spend all my life arround the seven seas if I could.
